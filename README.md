# CSTK
Cyber Security Tool Kit

This project downloads and installs required tools for pen-testing, and data analysis. It is built and designed with the intent to integrate into any existing tools such as Wigle, Trello, JIRA, and/or Slack while following KISS principles. This tool kit is meant to simplify pen-testing for developers and engineers to secure their products and/or code. The main goal is to be able to use this tool kit without requiring specialized training.
